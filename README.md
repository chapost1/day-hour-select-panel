# DayHourSelectPanel

Angular Component I did for work purposes, including drag select types and etc with specific stylings as I have been requested to implement.

Select Options:

1. Toggle By Click
2. Drag Select
3. In the original component I had to implement shift, by I decided not to upload it becuase I see it useless when we have dragging
4. Click on Day / Hour Button
