# DayHourSelectPanel

Angular Component I did for work purposes, including drag select types and etc with specific stylings as I have been requested to implement.

Why?
Becuase we are having some Entities (i.e: Automation Rules)
which are need a scheduling plan to let the clients to schedule exactly the day and hours they will be used.
this panel is a part of the edit/create entity form (optional, default is always).

Select Options:

1. Toggle By Click
2. Drag Select
3. In the original component I had to implement shift, but I decided not to upload it becuase I see it useless when we have dragging
4. Click on Day / Hour Button
