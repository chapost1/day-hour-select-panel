# DayHourSelectPanel

Angular Component I did for work purposes, including drag select types and etc with specific stylings as I have been requested to implement.

Why?
Becuase we are having some Entities (i.e: Automation Rules)
which are need a scheduling plan to let the clients to schedule exactly the day and hours they will be used.
this panel is a part of the edit/create entity form (optional, default is always).

How To Select: (options)
1. Toggle By Click.
2. Drag Select (cancel on escape).
3. Click on Day / Hour (Those are buttons).
4. The original component has shift method, which is omitted. It's redundant when we have drag-selection.
